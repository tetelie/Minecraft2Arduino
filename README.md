# Description

Minecraft2Arduino is a project that enables interactions between Minecraft and Arduino, allowing actions in the real world based on in-game events. Think of it as a direct portal between Minecraft and reality!


# Summary

# Global Architecture
The system consists of three main components: <br>
  1. Arduino: Connects to the gateway via WebSockets and executes received commands. <br>
  2. Gateway: Acts as a WebSocket server relaying messages between Arduino and Minecraft. <br>
  3. Minecraft Plugin: Captures in-game interactions and forwards them to the gateway. <br>

# Arduino Side
ðŸ“‚ Code Location: [Microcontroller](./scripts/script.sh)
<br><br>
The Arduino connects to the gateway using WebSockets and processes incoming messages to perform actions in the real world.

Libraries Used:
- WiFi.h (for network connectivity)
- ArduinoWebsockets.h (to communicate via WebSockets)
- string.h (for handling strings)

# Gateway Side
ðŸ“‚ Code Location: [WebSocketGateway](./scripts/script.sh)
<br><br>
The gateway is a WebSocket server that facilitates communication between Arduino and Minecraft.

Technology Stack:
- Node.js (for WebSocket server implementation)
- ws package (for WebSocket handling)

# Minecraft Side
ðŸ“‚ Code Location: [Plugin](./scripts/script.sh)
<br><br>
A Minecraft plugin that captures player interactions and transmits relevant data to the gateway.

Libraries Used:
- Spigot-API (to interact with Minecraft server events)
- Socket (to communicate with the gateway)
